## 🎬 How It Works (Simple Version)

### **Step 1: Someone Becomes a Lead**

A "lead" is just a **potential customer** - someone who might buy your service.

**How they become a lead:**
- Fill out a form on your website
- Book an appointment
- Send you an email
- You add them manually
- You import a list from Excel
- They sync from your booking system (CRM)

**It doesn't matter how they become a lead - the app handles it!**

### **Step 2: App Does Everything Automatically**

Once someone becomes a lead, the app:

1. **Saves their information**
   - Name, email, phone, etc.
   - Stores it safely in the app

2. **Sends a welcome email**
   - Automatically writes a nice welcome message
   - Sends it to them
   - You don't have to do anything!

3. **Creates a conversation**
   - Starts tracking all communication
   - You can see it in the "Conversations" tab

4. **Reminds you later**
   - If you haven't contacted them in 3 days
   - App reminds you to follow up
   - Never miss an opportunity!

### **Step 3: You Manage Everything in One Place**

Instead of checking:
- ❌ Multiple email accounts
- ❌ Spreadsheets
- ❌ Booking systems
- ❌ Notes on paper

You just:
- ✅ Open the app
- ✅ See all your leads
- ✅ See all conversations
- ✅ Everything in one place!

## 🤖 What Is "Automation"?

**Automation** = Things happen **automatically** without you doing anything.

### **Example:**

**Without Automation:**
```
New person contacts you
    ↓
You have to:
1. Copy their email
2. Open your email
3. Write a welcome message
4. Send it
5. Remember to follow up later
```

**With Automation:**
```
New person contacts you
    ↓
App automatically:
1. Saves their info ✅
2. Sends welcome email ✅
3. Creates conversation ✅
